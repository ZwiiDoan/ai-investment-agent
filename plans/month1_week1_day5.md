**Month 1 — Week 1 — Day 5: Documentation & ADRs**

**Task:** Draft ADR #1 — *Why Python + FastAPI as the base stack*

**Purpose:**
This day consolidates design reasoning into formal documentation. ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) serve as long-term artifacts explaining *why* a specific technology or approach was chosen.

**Expected output:**

* 1–2 pages ADR (Markdown format).
* Include:

  1. **Context:** project scope and backend needs.
  2. **Decision:** Python + FastAPI chosen.
  3. **Rationale:** simplicity, async performance, strong AI library ecosystem, easy experimentation.
  4. **Alternatives:** Go, Node.js.
  5. **Consequences:** faster prototype cycles, eventual migration path possible.

**Outcome:**
Clear, reviewable document supporting architectural transparency.
Contributes to Month 1 deliverables (3 ADRs total, including RAG and scaling later).
