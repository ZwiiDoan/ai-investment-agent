**Month 1 — Week 3, Day 6 plan (Frontend Literacy)**

Focus: connect and visualize the query flow between **Next.js** frontend and the **FastAPI** backend.
Duration: 1 hour.

### Tasks

1. **Frontend Integration**

   * Use `fetch` or `axios` to call the `/query` API endpoint built earlier.
   * Display AI-generated responses dynamically.
   * Implement loading and error states.

2. **UI Improvement**

   * Build a minimal layout using `Next.js` + TailwindCSS.
   * Add a simple input box for user queries and a “Submit” button.
   * Render response in a styled card or table.

3. **Optional Enhancements**

   * Persist query history locally (in memory or localStorage).
   * Add pagination if responses are long.

4. **Goal Output**

   * Working Next.js page that connects to backend API and shows results.
   * Verified API integration end-to-end.

This aligns with the weekly cadence’s **Frontend Literacy** slot and with Week 3’s frontend milestone to *“Call query API from Next.js and render response.”*
