**Month 1 – Week 2 – Day 6 Plan**
Focus: Frontend Literacy

### Task

Create a **Next.js sample insights page** that connects to your backend.

* Show mock investment data (e.g., 3 sample news titles, sentiment scores).
* Add basic layout (header, cards, pagination placeholder).
* Prepare to later call the `/query` API endpoint when it’s ready.

### Learning Target

* Review **Next.js fetch from API routes**.
* Understand **Next.js → FastAPI** cross-origin setup (CORS).
* Add minimal Tailwind UI component usage for quick layout.

### Output

* One running **Next.js frontend page** displaying static “sample insights.”
* Commit with message:

  ```
  feat(frontend): add sample insights page
  ```

This aligns with the weekly cadence’s frontend literacy goal (Day 6) and supports the RAG ADR and backend integration planned for Week 3.
